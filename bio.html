    <h4>Professional Bio</h4>
    <p>I am an analytical thinker currently working as an Asset Manager for a real estate firm in Saint Louis. My current position involves me to account and track the daily capital and operational expenses for the business. I am constantly analyzing and searching for cost saving solutions and building financial models for perspective projects to derive whether they would align with our business targets. I am in regular conversations with business partners and stakeholders across the spectrum to ensure high level of efficiency.  </p>
    <h4>Education</h4>
    <p>I flew in to America in September 2015 to complete my Masters in Finance at Hult International Business School in Boston. I have a Bachelors in Accounting and Finance from Mumbai University. I also have completed a Certification in Data Analytics and Visualization from Washington University.  </p>
